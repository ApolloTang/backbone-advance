model.toJSON() is the opposite of model.parse()

model.parse() is used to modify data from server
while model.toJSON modify when data is send to server

[!] if you use toJSON() to modify data send then
you cannot use toJSON() to serilize modeldata to json.
instead you use
     _.close(this.attributes)
in place of toJSON() if fact that is how toJSON()
does internally.
